       "- Military and defense\n",
       "  - India has the third largest military force in the world.\n",
       "  - It is a nuclear weapon state.\n",
       "\n",
       "- History (highlights)\n",
       "  - The history covers thousands of years with diversity in languages, cultures, periods, and dynasties.\n",
       "  - Civilizational roots trace to the Indus Valley; evidence of early humans (Homo erectus) in India dating 200,000–500,000 years ago.\n",

Narasimha Rao with the leadership of Manmohan Singh.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall takeaway: India is a vast, densely populated, historically rich country in South Asia with a diverse economy, strong service and IT sectors, a long-standing democratic system, and significant cultural and linguistic variety."
